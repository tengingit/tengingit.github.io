I'm a third year Ph.D Candidate, advised by Prof.[Min-Ling ZHANG](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/zhangml/) in [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/), Southeast University. My research interest lie in the realms of machine learning and data mining, with a particular focus on multi-dimensional classification.
